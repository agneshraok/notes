- A tracking branch is a local branch that represents a remote master branch.
- Locally a tracking branch name will be of the form <remote>/<branch>

- tracking branch update seperate of local aswell as remote branch, This is because tracking branches are only updated with the network commands like clone, fetch, pull and push. (and not with commit command as it is a local command!)


- To view tracking branches we must use `git branch --all`
