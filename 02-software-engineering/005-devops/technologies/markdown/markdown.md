# Hardbreak

This is a a paragraph showing how to use hardbreak and softbreak.

This right here is a hardbreak as I have left an entire line of space.

<br/>

# Softbreak

However, if we leave exactly 2 spaces after a sentence it'll be a softbreak. You can see here  
I left 2 space's after the word here.  

<br/>

# Indentation
Use softbreak and then `&emsp;`  

This right here   
&emsp; is how you indent  
&emsp; &emsp; Gotta use softbreak(i.e. atleast a space is left at the end of previous line.)!
