At the most basic level, a data structure is a way to group together related data elements and a strategy for using those data.

### 2.6.1 structs (Creating `Sales_data`)

~~~cpp
struct Sales_data {
    std::string bookISBN;
    unsigned units_sold = 0;
    double revenue = 0.0;
};
~~~

> The close curly that ends the class body must be followed by a semicolon.

The data members of a class define the contents of the objects of that class type.

Our class has three data members: 
1. a member of type string named `bookNo`. 
1. an unsigned member named `units_sold`.
1. a member of type double named `revenue`.


Each Sales_data object will have these three data members.

- we can supply an in-class initializer for a data member, which will be used to initialize the data members.
- Members without an initializer are default initialized.

### 2.6.2 Using Sales_data

the data members in structs can be accessed using the dot operator.

~~~cpp
//given that Sales_data is defined as given in the above code.

int main(){
    Sales_data data1;
    std::cout << "enter isbn..." << std::endl;
    std::cin >> data1.bookISBN;    //accesing data member of the struct.
}
~~~

### 2.6.3 Writing own header files

- When we define a class, there may be only one definition of that class in any given source file.
- In addition, if we use a class in several different files, the classâ€™s definition must be the same in each file.
- For the above reason, they are generally defined in header files.
