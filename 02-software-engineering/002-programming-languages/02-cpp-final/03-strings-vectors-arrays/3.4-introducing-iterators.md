- Like pointers (§ 2.3.2 ), iterators give us indirect access to an object.
- In the case of an iterator, that object is an element in a container or a character in a string.
- As with pointers, an iterator may be valid or invalid. 
	- A valid iterator either denotes an element or denotes a position one past the last element in a container. 
	- All other iterator values are invalid.

## 3.4.1 Using Iterators

- Unlike pointers, we do not use the address-of operator to obtain an iterator. Instead, types that have iterators have members that return iterators. 
- In particular, these types have members named `begin` and `end`. The begin member returns an iterator that denotes the first element (or first character), if there is one
```cpp
auto b = v.begin(), e = v.end(); // band ehave the same type
```
- The iterator returned by end is an iterator positioned “one past the end” of the associated container (or string).
- The iterator returned by end is often referred to as the off-the end iterator or abbreviated as “the end iterator.” 
- If the container is empty, begin returns the same iterator as the one returned by end.
- In general, we do not know (or care about) the precise type that an iterator has.

### Iterator Operations

Iterators support only a few operations, which are listed in Table 3.6.

- Iterators are equal if they denote the same element or if they are both off-the-end iterators for the same container.


<br/>

### Moving Iterators from One Element to Another

- Iterators use the increment (++) operator (§ 1.4.1) to move from one element to the next. Incrementing an iterator is a logically similar operation to incrementing an integer. 
- In the case of integers, the effect is to “add 1” to the integer’s value. In the case of iterators, the effect is to “advance the iterator by one position.”

> Because the iterator returned from end does not denote an element, it may not be incremented or dereferenced.

### Iterator Types

the library types that have iterators define types named `iterator` and `const_iterator` that represent actual iterator types:

```cpp
vector<int>::iterator it; // it can read and write vector<int>elements
string::iterator it2; // it2 can read and write characters in a string 
vector<int>::const_iterator it3; // it3 can read but not write elements 
string::const_iterator it4;// it4 can read but not write characters
```

A `const_iterator` behaves like a const pointer (§ 2.4.2). Like a const pointer, a `const_iterator` may read but not write the element it denotes; an object of type iterator can both read and write.
- If a vector or string is `const`,we may use only its `const_iterator` type. 
- With a non const vector or string, we can use either iterator or `const_iterator`.
