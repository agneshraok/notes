An array is similar to a vector but offers more performance at the cost of flexibility.

- Like a vector, an array is a container of unnamed objects of a single type that we access by position. 
- Unlike a vector, arrays have fixed size; we cannot add elements to an array.

# 3.5.1 Defining and Initialising built-in arrays

- Array is a compound type.
- An array declarator has the form `a[d]`, where a is the name being defined and d is the dimension of the array.
- As dimension is a part of array's type, it must be known at compile time, which means that the dimension must be a constant expression.

    ```cpp
    unsigned cnt = 42;          // not a constant expression
    constexpr unsigned sz = 42; // constant expression
    int arr[10];                // array of ten ints
    int *parr[sz];              // array of 42 pointers to int
    string bad[cnt];            // error: cnt is not a constant expression
    string strs[get_size()];    // ok if get_size is constexpr, error otherwise
    ```

- By default, the elements in an array are default initialized
- As with variables of built-in type, a default-initialized array of built-in type that is defined inside a function will have undefined values.
- When we define an array, we must specify a type for the array. We cannot use `auto` to deduce the type from a list of initializers. 
- As with vector, arrays hold objects. Thus, there are no arrays of references
