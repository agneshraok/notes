A vector is a collection of objects, all of which have the same type. 

- A vector is often referred to as a container because it “contains” other objects. 
- To use a vector, we must include the appropriate header.
	```cpp
	#include <vector> 
	using std::vector;
	```
- A vector is a class template. writing templates is an advanced topic.
	- Templates are not themselves functions or classes. Instead, they can be thought of as instructions to the compiler for generating classes or functions. The process that the compiler uses to create classes or functions from templates is called instantiation. When we use a template, we specify what kind of class or function we want the compiler to instantiate.
	- For a class template, we specify which class to instantiate by supplying additional information, the nature of which depends on the template. How we specify the information is always the same: We supply it inside a pair of angle brackets following the template’s name. 
	- In the case of vector, the additional information we supply is the type of the objects the vector will hold:
	
		```cpp
		vector<int> ivec; // ivec holds objects of type int
		vector<Sales_item> Sales_vec; // holds Sales_items vector<vector<string>> file; // vectorwhose elements are vectors
		```
	
> 	vector is a template, not a type. Types generated from vector must include the element type, for example, `vector<int>`.

* Because references are not objects (§ 2.3.1), we cannot have a vector of reference

## 3.3.1 Defining and Initializing vectors

We can default initialize a vector, which creates an empty vector of the specified type:
```cpp
vector<string> svec; // default initialization; svechas no elements
```

We can also supply initial value(s) for the element(s) when we define a vector. (we can use a vector as an initializer)
```cpp
vector<int> ivec; // initially empty
// give ivecsome values 
vector<int> ivec2(ivec); // copy elements ofivec into ivec2 
vector<int> ivec3 = ivec; // copy elements ofivec into ivec3 
vector<string> svec(ivec2); // error: svec holds strings, not ints
```

<br/>

### List Initializing a vector 

```cpp
vector<string> articles = {"a", "an", "the"};
```

We cannot supply a list of initializers using parentheses:
```cpp
vector<string> v2("a", "an", "the"); // error
```

<br/>

### Creating a Specified Number of Elements

We can also initialize a vector from a __count__ and an __element__ __value__. The count determines how many elements the vector will have; the value provides the initial value for each of those elements:

```cpp
vector<int> ivec(10, -1); // ten intelements, each initialized to -1 
vector<string> svec(10, "hi!"); // ten strings; each element is "hi!"
```

<br/>

### Value Initialization

- We can usually omit the value and supply only a size. 
- In this case the library creates a value-initialized element initializer for us. This library-generated value is used to initialize each element in the container. The value of the element initializer depends on the type of the elements stored in the vector.

### List Initializer or Element Count?

In a few cases, what initialization means depends upon whether we use curly braces or parentheses to pass the initializer(s). 

```cpp
vector<int> v1(10); // v1has ten elements with value 0 
vector<int> v2{10}; // v2has one element with value 10 
vector<int> v3(10, 1); // v3has ten elements with value 1 
vector<int> v4{10, 1}; // v4has two elements with values 10and 1
```
- When we use parentheses, we are saying that the values we supply are to be used to construct the object.
- When we use curly braces, {...}, we’re saying that, if possible, we want to list initialize the object. 
- On the other hand, if we use braces and there is no way to use the initializers to list initialize the object, then those values will be used to construct the object.
	```cpp
	vector<string> v5{"hi"}; // list initialization: v5has one element 
	vector<string> v6("hi"); // error: can’t construct a vector from a string literal 
	vector<string> v7{10};   // v7has ten default-initialized elements 
	vector<string> v8{10, "hi"}; // v8has ten elements with value "hi"
	```
	- Although we used braces on all but one of these definitions, only v5 is list initialized.

<br/>
<br/>

## 3.3.2 Adding Elements to a vector

The `push_back` operation takes a value and “pushes” that value as a new last element onto the “back” of the vector. 

```cpp
vector<int> v2; // empty vector
for (int i = 0; i != 100; ++i) v2.push_back(i); // append sequential integers to v2
// at end ofloop v2has 100 elements, values 0.. . 99
```

<br/>

### Programming Implications of Adding Elements to a vector

- We must ensure that any loops we write are correct even if the loop changes the size of the vector.
- For reasons we’ll explore in § 5.4.3 (p. 188), we cannot use a range for if the body of the loop adds elements to the vector.
