___A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate.___
- Each variable in C++ has a type. The type determines the size and layout of the variable’s memory, the range of values that can be stored within that memory, and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. 
- C++ programmers tend to refer to variables as “variables” or “objects” interchangeably.

<br/>

## 2.2.1 Variable Definitions

- A simple variable definition consists of a __type specifier__, followed by a list of one or more variable names separated by commas, and ends with a semicolon.
- A definition may (optionally) provide an initial value for one or more of the names it defines

```cpp
int sum=0, value, units_sold =0 ;
```

<br/>

###  Initializers

- An object that is initialized gets the specified value at the moment it is created.
- When a definition defines two or more variables, the name of each object becomes visible immediately. Thus, it is possible to initialize a variable to the value of one defined earlier in the same definition.

> Initialization in C++ is a surprisingly complicated topic. Many programmers are confused by the use of the = symbol to initialize a variable. _It is tempting to think of initialization as a form of assignment, but initialization and assignment are different operations in C++_.

> Initialization is not assignment. Initialization happens when a variable is given a value when it is created. Assignment obliterates an object’s current value and replaces that value with a new one.

<br/>

### List Initialization

we can use any of the following four different ways to define an` int` variable named `units_sold` and initialize it to 0:
```cpp
int units_sold = 0; 
int units_sold = {0}; 
int units_sold{0};  // This is list initialzation
int units_sold(0);
```

<br/>

### Default Initialization

When we define a variable without an initializer, the variable is default initialized. Such variables are given the “default” value. What that default value is depends on the type of the variable and may also depend on where the variable is defined.

## 2.2.2 Variable Declarations and Definitions

- ___Separate compilation___ lets us split our programs into several files, each of which can be compiled independently.
	- When we separate a program into multiple files, we need a way to share code across those files. 
	- To support separate compilation, C++ distinguishes between declarations and definitions.  
   
- A declaration makes a name known to the program. A file that wants to use a name defined elsewhere includes a declaration for that name. 

- A definition creates the associated entity.

<br/>

- A variable declaration specifies the type and name of a variable. A variable definition is a declaration. In addition to specifying the name and type, a definition also allocates storage and may provide the variable with an initial value.

- To obtain a declaration that is not also a definition, we add the extern keyword and may not provide an explicit initializer:
	```cpp
	extern int i; // declares but does not define i.
	int j;	// declares and defines j.
	```
 - We can provide an initializer on a variable defined as extern, but doing so overrides the extern.An extern that has an initializer is a definition:
	```cpp
	extern double pi = 3.1416; // definition
	```
- It is an error to provide an initializer on an extern inside a function.

> Variables must be defined exactly once but can be declared many times.

- To use the same variable in multiple files, we must define that variable in one—and only one—file. Other files that use that variable must declare—but not define—that variable.

## 2.2.3 Identifiers

An identifier is **a sequence of characters used to denote one of the following:** **Object or variable name**.

- Identifiers in C++ can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. 
- The language imposes no limit on name length. 
- Identifiers must begin with either a letter or an underscore. 
- Identifiers are case-sensitive; upper- and lowercase letters are distinct.
	```cpp
	// defines four different intvariables 
	int somename, someName, SomeName, SOMENAME;
	```
- The language reserves a set of names, listed in Tables 2.3 and Table 2.4, for its own use. These names may not be used as identifiers
- The identifiers we define in our own programs may not contain two consecutive underscores
- Nor can an identifier begin with an underscore followed immediately by an uppercase letter. 
- In addition, identifiers defined outside a function may not begin with an underscore.

### Conventions for Variable Names

- An identifier should give some indication of its meaning. 
- Variable names normally are lowercase—`index`,not `Index` or `INDEX`. 
- Like `Sales_item`, classes we define usually begin with an uppercase letter.
- Identifiers with multiple words should visually distinguish each word, for example, `student_loan` or `studentLoan`,not `studentloan`.

## 2.2.4 Scope of a Name

- A scope is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meaning.
- Most scopes in C++ are delimited by curly braces.
- The same name can refer to different entities in different scopes. 
- Names are visible from the point where they are declared until the end of the scope in which the declaration appears.

`
 > ADVICE:DEFINE VARIABLES WHERE YOU FIRST USE THEM

It is usually a good idea to define an object near the point at which the object is first used. Doing so improves readability by making it easy to find the definition of the variable. More importantly, it is often easier to give the variable a useful initial value when the variable is defined close to where it is first used.


<br/>

### Nested Scopes

Scopes can contain other scopes. The contained (or nested) scope is referred to as an __inner scope__, the containing scope is the __outer scope__.

- Once a name has been declared in a scope, that name can be used by scopes nested inside that scope. 
- Names declared in the outer scope can also be redefined in an inner scope

> It is almost always a bad idea to define a local variable with the same name as a global variable that the function uses or might use.
