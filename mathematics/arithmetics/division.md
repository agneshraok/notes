# Eculidean Division (Integer Division)

<br>

## Terminology

- The **_dividend_** is the number that you are dividing into smaller parts.
- The **_divisor_** is the number by which you are dividing the dividend. It determines how many equal parts the dividend will be split into.
- The **_quotient_** is the result of the division operation. It represents the number of times the divisor "fits" into the dividend evenly. It's the whole number portion of the result.
- The **_remainder_** is what's left over when the divisor doesn't divide the dividend perfectly. In other words, it's the amount that is left after distributing the divisor as many times as possible while still staying within the dividend.

## Illustration

- Example of complete division, When we divide 4 by 2, it divides equally into 2 equal parts. Hence the quotient is 2. Since there is nothing left after distributing the divisor the remainder is 0.

  ```
  4/2

  dividend : 4
  divisor : 2
  quotient : 2
  remainder : 0
  ```

- Example of incomple division, When we divide 15 by 20. 20 cannot divide 15 into equal parts, hence the quotient is 0. Since 15 is left after distributing the divisor the remainder is 15.

  ```
  15/20

  dividend : 15
  divisor : 20
  quotient : 0
  remainder : 15
  ```

# Decimal Devision

Decimal division is an extension of integer division that allows for fractions or decimals in the quotient. When dividing, you might get a recurring decimal or a finite decimal that doesn't terminate.
