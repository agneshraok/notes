# Permutations and Combinations

- Permutation is the method of selecting items from a set where order is important.
- Combination is a similar method where order is not important.

- Example:

  ```
  Permutations of 2 items from ['A', 'B']: [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'A')]
  Combinations of 2 items from ['A', 'B']: [('A', 'B')]
  ```
