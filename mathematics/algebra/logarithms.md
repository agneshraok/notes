# Logarithms

The logarithm base $a$ of $x$ is the exponent to which the base $a$ must be raised to produce the number $x$.

- For $\log_2(8)$, it is as good as asking "To what power must 2 be raised to get 8?" and the answer is 3 i.e. $2^3 = 8$.

$$\log_a(x) = y$$
$$x = a^y$$

Alternatively, The logarithm base $a$ of $x$ is the number of times $x$ must be divided by $a$ to get 1.
