Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Agnesh Rao K, I have done my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, and I am currently pursuing MTech in Industrial Automation and Robotics from Manipal Institute of Technology. Right now, I am working as a Software Developer intern at Altair's Hyperworks team as a part of my curriculum.

Rohit Nayak Sir suggested me to reach out to you to prepare myself from a career point of view, your expertise and experience would be invaluable to me as I seek to learn and grow, and I believe that having a mentor like you would be an invaluable asset to my professional development.Â  I would be grateful for any guidance or resources you could provide, and I would be happy to make myself available at your convenience to discuss this further. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Agnesh Rao K
