## Conventions

- Personally I like to mix Hungarian Notation for naming QT variables, especially related to GUI. This is helpful when using Tab completion, if we want to add a layout, all the possible layout in the code is organised in tab completion.

  ```cpp
  QVBoxLayout layout_top;
  QPushButton push_btn_delete;
  ```
