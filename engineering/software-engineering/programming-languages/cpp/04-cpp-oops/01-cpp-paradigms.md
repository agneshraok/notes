> <br> C++ is a general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. <br> <br>

<br>

# Procedural Programming

- procedural programming is basically a collection of functions, where data (usually declared seperately) are manipulated.
- limitations:
  - functions need to know the structure of data, if structure of the data is changed, then the function must also change for it to work.
  - as programs get large, it is difficult to understand, maintain, reuse, debug, extend.

# Object Oriented Programming

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs.
- OOP in C++ is based on the concept of classes. A class is a blueprint for an object. It defines the data that an object will hold and the methods that an object will have.
- When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class. The object will have its own copy of the data that is defined in the class, and it will be able to call the methods that are defined in the class.

- Advantages:

  - Abstraction : Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user, and only the functional details will be available to the user end.
  - Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a method of wrapping up the data and code acting on the data into a single unit.
  - Inheritence : Creating new classes by using the code present in already defined classes, extending the data.
  - Polymorpism : Polymorphism is the ability to use the same code to operate on different types of objects. This makes the code more flexible.

- Limitations:
  - OOP is not a panacea, it will bad code even worse XD
  - complicated design
  - slower and larger in size

# Generic Programming

- Generic programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing code that is reusable across different data types. It allows you to create algorithms and data structures that can operate on a variety of types without the need for separate implementations for each type.

- Templates are the primary mechanism for achieving generic programming in C++. Function templates and class templates allow you to write code that can work with different types by using template parameters.
