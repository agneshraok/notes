# React

React is a front-end library that is used to build web applications.

- **React is based on Components.** Components are building blocks of UI in react.
- **React is Declarative.** We tell it what a component should look like using JSX.
- **React is State-driven.** React **_"reacts"_** to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
- **React is a Library** and not Framework as it is only the "view" layer. checkout [Difference between a framework and a library ](../front-end-frameworks.md#framework-vs-library)
- **React is Non-opinionated**, meaning there is no force to follow any specific design patterns, structure or logic.
