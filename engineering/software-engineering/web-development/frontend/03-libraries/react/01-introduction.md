# React

- React is a library and technically not a framework.
- React is non opinionated, meaning there is no force to follow any specific design patterns, structure or logic.

- A function that returns a jsx and whose name starts with a capital letter is a component.

## Library vs Framework

- Both library and framework are reuable code written by developers.
- What distinguishes them is a term called _"Inversion of control"_. When using a library, the dev is in charge of the flow of the application (when and where to call the library). When using a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.
