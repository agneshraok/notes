Had a quick turn of emotions today. Dad called today morning, told me yajju scored 604 in his weekly alva's NEET exam (A mark he has never crossed until now). Dad was super proud as he kept mentioning about it through out today. He also conveyed that he received my MIT scholarship of 42k, He straight forward told that he won't give me a penny, I was confused and slightly angry. Later he revealed that he wouldn't transfer that because he had paid 40k of my second year fee, which he did. Later tonight, I was discussing about getting maruti 800 restored. I believe this was the first time he opened up to me about his old times. He mentioned that if there were 2 people who helped him during his lowest time in his life (He told he had no money to buy slippers) it was Santhu Chikka and Guru Anna. He told he'll never forget their genuine help. Santhu Chikka is a gem, no doubt in that. Guru Anna apparently helped him from thailand, nobody knows about it, not even mom and now I know. He went on to say, He was earning 4x in his good time (I assume when he was in gulf) and then he had lost everything in his paint business due to Dodappa and his and dad's colleagues. He also told that he had gone to Anil Mama to ask for 10k when he needed to pay some urgent fee. At that time, Anil Mama had strictly told to pay back within a week. Dad then sold his gold braclet to pay him back. I wish he'll be more open to me as I grow older. I respect him more now.
